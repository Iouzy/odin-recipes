        <h4>
            If there’s one thing Portuguese cuisine does well, it’s comfort food. <br>
            Perhaps the best example is Bacalhau com Natas, or Salt Cod with Cream. <br>
            It’s a delicious combination of flaky bacalhau served in a mixture of cream, potatoes,<br>
            and onion, then topped with cheese and baked in the oven.<br>
            On a chilly evening it doesn’t get much better than taking a scoop of creamy Bacalhau com Natas <br>
            from a freshly baked oven dish. Its origins aren’t known, <br>
            but it’s one of the most popular ways of serving bacalhau you’ll find in Portugal.<br>

            <li>3 garlic cloves – minced</li>
            <li>1 bay leaf</li>
            <li>1tbsp butter</li>
            <li>1tbsp flour</li>
            <li>300ml milk</li>
            <li>200ml natas frescas (fresh cream)</li>

            <li>100g mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>50g parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse and drain the soaked cod, place it in a medium pot, and cover it with hot water.<br> 
            Place it over a medium heat, bring it to a boil, and let it simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain the fish, saving 1 cup of the water.</li>
            <li>In another medium-size pot, combine the butter, flour, and a drizzle of olive oil.<br> 
                Place It over low to medium heat. After the butter has melted, cook the mixture for around 2 minutes, constantly stirring.</li>
            <li>Add the milk and fish water, continue stirring until thickened. <br>
                We want a bechamel consistency.</li>
            <li>Stir in the natas (fresh cream), season it with nutmeg, salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Place a frying pan over medium heat, add a tbsp of olive oil, the onions and garlic. Fry them till the onions are translucent. <br>
                 Add the fish and fry for another 5 minutes. Transfer it to a mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Cover the bottom of the same frying pan with olive oil. Fry the potatoes in batches, till golden brown. <br>
                Rest it on some absorbent towels to drain any excessive oil.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 200 Celsius.</li>
            <li>Combine the fish sauce, the potatoes, and the fish. Place it on a baking dish, sprinkle the cheese on top.</li>
            <li>Place it in the oven and roast it for 20 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown.</li>
            <li>Serve sprinkled with some fresh parsley.</li>
        </ol>
