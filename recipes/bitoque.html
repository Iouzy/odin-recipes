            <li>Paprika</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper</li>
            <li>Minced or sliced garlic</li>
            <li>Garlic powder</li>
            <li>Onion powder</li>
            <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Cornstarch</li>
            <li>Red or Madeira wine</li>
            <li>Salted butter</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>Garnish: black Portuguese olives (optional)</li>
            <li></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Pat the steaks dry, and season them with salt, pepper, paprika, onion powder, and garlic powder. <br>
                Place the steaks in a bowl and cover the bowl with plastic wrap. <br>
                Let the seasoned steaks marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour, or overnight. 
            </li>
            <li>Remove the steaks from the refrigerator and let them rest at room temperature for 15-20 minutes prior to searing them.<br>
                 While the steaks are resting, prepare the slurry by whisking the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup. 
            </li>
            <li> Pre-heat a large cast iron skillet over a high-flame. Once you start to see smoke rising from the skillet, brush the skillet with 2 tablespoons of olive oil .<br>
                 Sear each steak for 1-2 minutes on each side. Once seared on both sides, transfer the steaks to a plate, and cover the plate with foil to keep the steaks warm.</li>
            <li>Turn the flame under the skillet all the way down and pour the wine in to de-glaze the skillet. Loosen any bits from the bottom of the pan using wooden spoon or rubber spatula.<br>
                 Add the butter, sliced or minced, garlic and sweet peppers to the skillet and continue to stir until the butter melts. <br>
                 Pour in in the water/cornstarch slurry, give one last stir, and let the sauce simmer for about 5 minutes on the lowest heat setting. Turn the flame off and stir in the chopped cilantro.</li>
            <li>In a separate frying-pan or skillet, crack the eggs and fry them to your liking. Sunny-side up is the traditional way, but you can also prepare the eggs over easy. <br>
                Season the eggs with a little salt and black pepper.

            </li>
            <li>Plate the steaks and spoon the pan-sauce over them. Top each steak with a fried egg, and serve with white rice and fried potatoes on the side. <br>
                Optional – garnish with a few black Portuguese olives and a sprinkle of fresh chopped cilantro.</li>
